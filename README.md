# photoMergeAutomation

the script is done motivated by my daughter Jessie and my wife Zelin

We took Jessie's video everyday and most of them are uploaded to our NAS via DS Moment. We want to compile one video for each month of our little Jessie. As a software engineer, I will automate this process.

Prerequsite:
1. Shell support
2. ffmpeg installed

Run the script now will produce Jessie's video of format `Jessie-<year>-<month>.mp4`
